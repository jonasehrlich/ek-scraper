## Configuration

### Searches

Searches can be configured in the `searches` array of the configuration file.
Each of the searches can be configured with the following parameters.

| Name        | Description                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | Name of the search, use a descriptive one (required)                               |
| `url`       | URL of the first page of your search (required)                                    |
| `recursive` | Whether to follow all pages of the search result <br/>(optional, defaults to true) |

### Filter

Filters can be configured in the `filter` section of the configuration file to exclude specific ads
from your scrape results on the client side. The following settings can be configured.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `exclude_topads` | Whether to exclude top ads from the results (optional, defaults to true) |
| `exclude_patterns` | Case-insensitive regular expression patterns used to exclude ads (optional) |

### Notifications

Notifications can be configured in the `notifications` section of the configuration file.

#### Push notifications using [Pushover](https://pushover.net/)

![Screenshot of a push notification using Pushover](assets/pushover-notification.jpeg)

`ek-scraper` supports push notifications to your devices using [Pushover](https://pushover.net/).
For further information on the service check their terms and conditions.

The implementation for _Pushover_ notifications will send a single notification per search, if new
ads are discovered.

To configure _Pushover_ for notifications from the scraper, first register at the service and create
an application (e.g. `ek-scraper`). To use the service in `ek-scraper`, add the `pushover` object
to the `notifications` object in your configuration file and fill the API tokens. Selection of the
devices which will receive the notifications, is supported using the `device` array.

| Name     | Description |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `token`  | API token of the Pushover app (required) |
| `user`   | API token of the Pushover user (required) |
| `device` | List of device names to send the notifications to <br/> (optional, defaults to all devices) |

#### Push notifications using [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/)

![Screenshot of a push notification using ntfy.sh](assets/ntfy-sh-notification.jpeg)

`ek-scraper` supports push notifications to your devices using [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/).
For further information on the service check their terms and conditions.

The implementation for _ntfy.sh_ notifications will send a single notification per search, if new
ads are discovered.

To configure _ntfy.sh_ for notifications from the scraper, define a topic and subscribe to it in the
mobile app.

> Note that topic names are public, so it's wise to choose something that cannot be guessed easily.
> This can be done by including a UUID, e.g. by running the following command in your shell:
>
> ``` sh
> echo "ek-scraper-$(uuidgen)"
> ```

To use the service in `ek-scraper`, add the `ntfy.sh` object to the `notifications` object in your
configuration file and add the topic you previously subscribed to.

| Name       | Description                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `topic`    | Topic to publish the notifications to                             |
| `priority` | Priority to send the notifications with (optional, defaults to 3) |

## Running `ek-scraper` regularly

> It should be avoided to run the tool too often to avoid getting your IP address blocked by
> [kleinanzeigen.de](kleinanzeigen.de)

To configure a cronjob, run
