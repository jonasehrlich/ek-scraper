| `recursive` | Whether to follow all pages of the search result <br/>(optional, defaults to true) |

#### Push notifications using Pushover

`ek-scraper` supports push notifications to your devices using [Pushover](https://pushover.net/).
For further information on the service check their terms and conditions.

The implementation for _Pushover_ notifications will send a single notification per search, if new ads are discovered.

To configure _Pushover_ for notifications from the scraper, first register at the service and create an application
(e.g. `ek-scraper`). To use the service in `ek-scraper`, add the `pushover` object to the `notifications` object in your
configuration file and fill the API tokens. Selection of the devices which will receive the notifications, is supported using the `device` array.

| Name | Description |
| ----- | ---------- |
| `token` | API token of the Pushover app (required) |
| `user` | API token of the Pushover user (required) |
| `device` | List of device names to send the notifications to <br/>(optional, defaults to all devices) |
